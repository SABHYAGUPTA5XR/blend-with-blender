# 🎨 Blender Projects: Basics of 3D Modeling

This repository contains two beginner-friendly 3D modeling projects created using **Blender**:
- **Project 1: Basic Chair**
- **Project 2: Classic Donut**

These projects helped me understand essential Blender tools, basic modeling techniques, texturing, and rendering workflows.

## 🪑 Project 1: Basic Chair
### Description
A simple wooden chair model focusing on:
- Primitive mesh editing (Cube, Cylinders)
- Object scaling, rotation, and positioning
- Basic material assignment (wood texture)
- Simple lighting and rendering

### Key Concepts Learned
- Mesh editing tools (Extrude, Loop Cut, Bevel)
- Object and Edit modes
- UV mapping basics
- Camera positioning for renders

## 🍩 Project 2: Classic Donut
### Description
A colorful, realistic donut model inspired by Blender's iconic beginner tutorial. Focused on:
- Shaping using modifiers (Subdivision Surface)
- Sculpting slight imperfections
- Applying textures (icing, sprinkles)
- Adding HDR lighting for realism

### Key Concepts Learned
- Sculpting basics
- Texture painting and PBR materials
- Lighting setups using HDRIs
- Final rendering techniques (Cycles Renderer)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Software**: Blender (version XX.X)
- **Rendering Engine**: Cycles
- **Textures**: Procedural + External Images
- **File Types**: `.blend`, `.png` (for renders)
